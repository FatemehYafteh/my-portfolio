          I am a front-end developer specialized in React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. 
          I love building clean, accessible, and user-friendly interfaces that feel natural
          across all devices.

        <p className="text-secondary leading-8">
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning new tools, finding design inspiration, 
          going to the gym, and spending quality time with my family.
